# dotfiles

Dotfiles for my Ubuntu 22.04 setup

## Install prerequisites

```
sudo apt install git
```

## Script options

-`./install.sh` installs all requirements for the CEG 2410 dotfiles assignment, must run as sudo. All subscripts are in "/sub-install-scripts"

- `./i3_install.sh` installs the i3 window manager, various packages, and sets up a fully customized environment to work in.Must run as sudo. All subscripts are in `/sub-i3-install-scripts`

## **Notice**

- Look through each script to make sure that it will work on your system. I cannot guarantee this will work on every system.
- `./i3_install.sh` is still a work in progress. Make sure you back up your existing config files before running it
